# IMoJIE_Faster_Copy_Attention

This is a simple repository holding scrips that were used for a German 'Besondere Lernleistung' alongside the paper.

As this work targets teachers it is written in a long but easier to understand manner suitable for any adept reader. If one searches to replicate the speed-up from 247.4 to 85.8 Seconds for IMoJIE without a degradation in time or any retraining, just copy code for the optimized gather_final_log_probs() function from the repo.
